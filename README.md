Version control systems (e.g., Git) enable seamless collaboration among developers.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.The Birth of Software Engineering (1968 NATO Conference)
Description: The term "software engineering" was first coined at the 1968 NATO Conference in Garmisch, Germany. This conference was held in response to the growing complexity of software systems and the so-called "software crisis," where projects were often over budget, late, and failed to meet user requirements. The conference brought together experts to discuss the challenges of software development and to establish software engineering as a disciplined and systematic approach to software creation.

Impact: This milestone marked the formal recognition of software engineering as a distinct field of study and practice. It led to the development of methodologies, best practices, and tools to manage the complexity of software projects, laying the foundation for modern software development processes.

2. The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s)
Description: The 1980s saw the rise of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages such as Smalltalk, C++, and later Java. OOP introduced concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism, which allowed developers to model real-world entities more effectively and build modular, reusable, and maintainable code.

Impact: OOP revolutionized software design and development by promoting code reuse, scalability, and maintainability. It became the dominant programming paradigm and influenced the design of many modern programming languages and frameworks. OOP also paved the way for design patterns and software architecture principles that are widely used today.

3. The Agile Manifesto (2001)
Description: In 2001, a group of software developers published the Agile Manifesto, which emphasized values such as individuals and interactions over processes and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation, and responding to change over following a plan. This marked a shift from traditional, rigid development methodologies (like Waterfall) to more flexible, iterative approaches.

Impact: The Agile movement transformed the software development landscape by promoting adaptive planning, continuous delivery, and close collaboration between developers and stakeholders. Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, have become the standard for many software development teams, enabling faster delivery of high-quality software and greater responsiveness to changing requirements.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
